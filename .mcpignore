# MCP Ignore File - Context Optimization
# This file works ON TOP of .gitignore
# Use it to exclude files from MCP context that you don't want AI to analyze
# 
# How it works:
# 1. .gitignore patterns are loaded first
# 2. .mcpignore patterns are added on top (additive)
# 3. All MCP tools respect both files
#
# Copy this file to .mcpignore and customize as needed
